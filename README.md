# Social Network API

## Description

This project was to create an API for a social network web app where users can share thoughts, reactions to their friend's thoughts, and create their own friends through a friend list.  I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database along with Mongoose ODM.  I maully seeded data using Insomnia.
